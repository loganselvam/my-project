          Hi, I'm Loganatha, a front-end web developer passionate about building user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Vue.js, with experience in Django, GraphQL, and WordPress.
          <br /><br />
          I’ve worked on projects like hospital websites and WiFi registration portals, focusing on performance and usability. Currently, I’m enhancing my skills in React and UI/UX design to create even more intuitive web applications.

          Excited to collaborate and contribute to innovative projects!
